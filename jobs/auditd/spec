  rules:
    description: Array of auditd rules to add. Note that this job does not update rules after rules are installed for the first time. Removal of a job does not remove rules. For new rules to be applied you must force VM recreation. This behaviour is due to auditd going into its immutable state.

    example:
    - "-a always,exit -F perm=x -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -F path=/usr/bin/who -k privileged"
  pre_start_delay:
    description: The number of seconds to delay running the pre-start script. This can be used, for example, to avoid a race condition with other pre-start scripts, such as IPsec's, that can prevent auditd From starting
